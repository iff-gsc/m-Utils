function [ superCellArray ] = setScellArrAt( superCellArray, idx, array) %#codegen
%setScellArrAt   assignes an array to the cell of an ScellArray depending
%   on the specified index.
%   An supercell array is a special struct containing two variables: data and
%   dimension. It features the same functionality as a cell array. As cell
%   arrays are not supported for code generation, supercell arrays provide an
%   alternative for cell arrays. The syntax is very similar to the syntax
%   of cell arrays.
%
% Syntax:  [ ScellArray ] = setScellArrAt( ScellArray, index, array )
%
%   The equivalent syntax of a cell array is
% Syntax:  CellArray{ index } = array
%
% Inputs:
%    superCellArray         The supercell in which one cell is supposed to be
%                           assigned. An arbitrary supercell array. Note that supercell
%                           arrays are special structs containing a variable
%                           called data and a variable called dim.
%    idx                    An index which has to be a positive integer and
%                           should not exceed the scell array dimension.  It
%                           indicates the column of the equivalent cell array
%                           which is supposed to be assigned.
%    array                  An array which can either be a N-D matrix, a vector or a
%                           scalar depending on the content of the ScellArray.
%                           This array is supposed to be assigned to the cell of
%                           the supercell array.
%
% Outputs:
%    superCellArray         The new supercell array in which one cell was
%                           assigned.
